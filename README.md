# HEART_PULSE_SENSOR
# Objective
The objective of a heart pulse sensor is to detect and measure the heartbeat or pulse rate of an individual by sensing blood flow changes in the body. These sensors are widely used in health monitoring systems and wearable devices.
# Tools & technologies
Arduino Uno.  
OLED Display.  
Jumper wire.  
Heart Pulse Sensor.
# Working Principle
The working principle of a heart pulse sensor is based on photoplethysmography (PPG), which detects changes in blood volume in tissues caused by the heart's pumping action. The sensor consists of a light-emitting diode (LED) and a photodetector, such as a photodiode or light-dependent resistor. The LED emits light, typically red or infrared, onto the skin. Some of this light is absorbed by the blood, while the rest is reflected or transmitted through the tissue. As the heart pumps blood, the blood volume in the tissue changes with each heartbeat, causing variations in the amount of light absorbed. These changes result in fluctuations in the intensity of the reflected or transmitted light, which are detected by the photodetector.
# Construction
step 1: Connect the pulse sensor  
1. Connect the vcc pin of the pulse sensor to the 5v pin on the arduino.  
2. Connect the gnd pin of the pulse sensor to the gnd pin on the arduino.  
3. Connect the signal pin of the pulse sensor to the a0 (analog input) pin on the arduino.  
step 2: Arduino code  
1. Install the pulse sensor playground library and upload the code.
step 3: testing  
1. Upload the code to the arduino.  
2. Open the serial monitor from the arduino ide to view your heart rate readings.
# Output
The sensor outputs the heart rate data to a microcontroller or display device for monitoring and also provide a visual indicator, like an LED blinking in sync with the heartbeat.
# Future Improvements
Future improvements in heart pulse sensors could focus on enhanced accuracy, motion artifact reduction, and AI-driven health insights. Integration with IoT and wearable technologies can enable better connectivity and real-time monitoring.
# Application
Heart pulse sensors are used in healthcare, fitness, and wearable devices for real-time heart rate monitoring, stress detection, and sleep tracking. They are also applied in medical diagnostics, gaming, and safety systems for enhanced health and user experiences.
